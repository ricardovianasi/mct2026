**Notes:** Image, Gallery will work if your website is public. From localhost to live website will not work as localhost is not publicly accessible. If you can set your website public, image, gallery fields will work.

**Notes for Taxonomy:** If you have already related terms of post, this plugin can import and attach terms to the post or custom post type. If you have hierarchical taxonomies, you must have taxonomies in your destination site. If slug of term is matched, it attaches to post. Otherwise, it creates a new term, but does not maintain hierarchy.
